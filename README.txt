How to compile file:
	- The bonus part of the assignment wasn't completed
	- This program takes 4 arguments: Assign4, input.txt, query.txt, output1.txt, output2.txt 
		- Assign4: The Driver class of program
		- input.txt: Input file containing the adjacency matrix
		- query.txt: Contains path to be found 
		- output1.txt: Depth first output of graph. doesnt contain output when path can be reached  
		- output2.txt: Breadth first output of graph. doesnt contain output when path can be reached
	 
Execute file:
	- You would need the following files in order to compile:
		- Assign4.java
		- BFS.java
		- DFS.java
		- input.txt
		- BinaryTree.java
		- query.txt
		- Queue.java
	- Write the following in the command line after compiling with javac : 
	- java Assign4 input.txt query.txt output1.txt output2.txt
